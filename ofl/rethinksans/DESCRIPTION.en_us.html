<p>Rethink is one of the largest global independent creative agencies. Founded in Vancouver in 1999, it now has offices in New York, Toronto, Vancouver, and Montréal. Rethink Sans was created in 2023 by Rethink’s ECD of Design Hans Thiessen. It was developed specifically to help everyone design with greater confidence and craft in Google Workspace.</p>

<p>Rethink Sans is a fork of <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/DM+Sans">DM Sans</a> (Colophon Foundry), which was designed from <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins">Poppins</a> (Jonny Pinhorn). Deceptively simple, Rethink Sans is filled with thoughtfully turbocharged features, including: weight-specific tracking, two styles of circled numbers a simple keystroke away, and tabular lining figures right out-of-the-box.</p>
