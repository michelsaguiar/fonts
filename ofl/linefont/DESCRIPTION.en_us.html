<p>Linefont is a is variable font with a Weight and Width axes for rendering small to medium-scale line charts.</p>

<p>Linefont values span from 0 to 100, assigned to different characters:
    <ul>
        <li>0-9 chars are for simplified manual input with step 10 (bar height = number).</li>
        <li>a-z/A-Z for manual input with step 2, softened at edges a and Z (bar height = number of letter).</li>
        <li>U+0100-017F for 0..127 values with step 1.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<p>Ranges, values and weight are compatible with <a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Wavefont">Wavefont</a> by the same author, so fonts can be swapped preserving visual coherency.</p>
