<p>Hedvig is a Scandinavian insurance company providing a predictable insurance experience for the next generation. Kanon Foundry was tasked to create a family of typefaces in collaboration with their in-house design department as a way to improve the visual experience of the brand. The idea was for the typeface to reflect Hedvig’s brand philosophy; to embrace the mistakes we make as humans.</p>

<p>The result was the typeface-family Hedvig Letters. It consists of two families; a serif variable font with an optical size axis, and one weight Sans Serif.</p>

<p>Hedvig Letters Serif was designed to balance the punchy and honest copy they use, with the responsibility and comfort they provide when they handle whatever trouble you get yourself or your stuff into.</p>

<p><a href="https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Hedvig+Letters+Sans"></a>Hedvig Letters Sans</a> takes the role of the work-horse typeface in Hedvig’s visual toolbox.</p>

<p>The concept was to imagine the letters from a “non-type-designer” point of view. The optical corrections usually applied to a typeface are a method of fooling the eye into perceiving certain shapes as balanced or aligned, when in reality it’s not. In other words, we trick the eye into thinking something is perfect when it’s not. So to embrace the mistakes —or in this case the imperfections— it was decided to not apply this kind of corrections, where the letterforms allowed it. This resulted in a typeface where some letters have a slightly odd, yet characteristic look that effectively communicates Hedvig’s design philosophy.</p>
